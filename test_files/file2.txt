Energy consumption is a critical concern in modern households, significantly impacting environmental sustainability and economic efficiency. However, many households lack the tools and insights to monitor and manage their energy usage effectively. This results in increased energy bills, wastage, and an unnecessary carbon footprint. Traditional energy tracking methods, like monthly bills, offer limited, retrospective data that fail to support proactive decision-making.
This project is meant to address some of these challenges by forming a Smart Energy Consumption Database in the form of a repository for all household energy-usage data. The Smart Energy Consumption Database will enhance real-time monitoring, intensive analysis, and actionable suggestions to foster sustainable energy practices in reducing costs and supporting greener futures.
